# Manny Silva

Technical writer by day, engineer by night, and father everywhere in between, I wear many (figurative) hats. I'm passionate about intuitive and scalable developer experiences, and I like diving into the deep end as the 0th user.

Here are a few things that keep me busy: 
- Head of Docs and UXW @ [Skyflow](docs.skyflow.com), a data privacy vault company
- Codifier of [Docs as Tests](www.docsastests.com), a tool-agnostic strategy for keeping docs and their products in sync by using doc content as product tests.
- Creator and maintainer of [Doc Detective](doc-detective.com), an open-source doc testing framework.
- AI development and experimentaion.

I'm always looking for collaborators on my projects, and I love chatting with folks, so don't hesitate to reach out.
